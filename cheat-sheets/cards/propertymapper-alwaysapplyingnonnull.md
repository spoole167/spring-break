PropertyMapper.alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull() is removed because skipping null values is now the default. Just delete the call.

## What You'll See {.error-output}

```error-output
$ mvn compile
[ERROR] /src/main/java/com/example/PropertyMapperUsage.java:[8,47]
  error: cannot find symbol
    symbol:   method alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull()
    location: class PropertyMapper
```

## What Changed {.what-changed}

<code>PropertyMapper.alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull()</code> is gone. Its behaviour, skipping mappings when the source value is <code>null</code>, is now the default for <code>PropertyMapper</code>, so calling it was a no-op from 4.0 onward.

## Why {.why-changed}

The non-null default was the right behaviour for virtually all use cases. Requiring an explicit opt-in call was boilerplate with no practical reason to exist. Making it the default and removing the method simplifies the API.

## The Fix {.diffs}

```diff-card
# // Remove the method call — the behaviour is now default
@@removed
PropertyMapper map = PropertyMapper.get().alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull();
@@added
PropertyMapper map = PropertyMapper.get();
```

## How To Fix {.fixes}

**Delete the alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull() call.**

Remove <code>.alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull()</code> from the chain. The mapper behaves identically on Boot 4.0 without it. If you explicitly want to map null values, use <code>.always()</code> on individual mappings.

## Scope Check {.scope-check}

Search for <code>alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull</code> across all Java/Kotlin sources. This typically appears in autoconfiguration classes or custom configuration adapters that mirror Spring Boot's internal style.

## Watch Out {.watch-out}

- If you were relying on the absence of <code>alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull()</code> to intentionally map null values through, that behaviour has also changed: nulls are now skipped by default. Add <code>.always()</code> on the specific mappings that need to pass nulls.

## Verify {.verify}

mvn compile: no cannot find symbol for alwaysApplyingWhenNonNull

## Further Info {.further-info}

PropertyMapper is an internal Spring Boot utility, used mostly in auto-configuration classes to map configuration properties onto builder objects.
