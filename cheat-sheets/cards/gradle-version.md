Spring Boot 4.0's Gradle plugin requires Gradle 8.14 or later. Older Gradle wrappers fail immediately at configuration time.

## What You'll See {.error-output}

```error-output
$ ./gradlew build
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* Where:
Build file '/project/build.gradle' line: 3
* What went wrong:
An exception occurred applying plugin request [id: 'org.springframework.boot', version: '4.0.0']
> Failed to apply plugin 'org.springframework.boot'.
   > Spring Boot plugin requires Gradle 8.14+. Found: 8.5.
```

## What Changed {.what-changed}

The Spring Boot Gradle plugin now requires Gradle 8.14 as a minimum. Gradle 9.0 is fully supported and recommended for new projects.

## Why {.why-changed}

Gradle 8.14 introduced configuration cache stability and improved dependency resolution APIs that the Spring Boot plugin now relies on. Supporting older Gradle versions held back build performance improvements.

## How To Fix {.fixes}

**Update the Gradle wrapper.**

Run <code>./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.14</code> (or <code>9.0</code>) to update the wrapper in place. Commit the updated wrapper files.

**Check plugin compatibility.**

After upgrading Gradle, run a build to verify all other plugins are compatible. The <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_8.html">Gradle upgrade guide</a> lists deprecations to address.

## Scope Check {.scope-check}

Check <code>gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties</code> for the current Gradle version. Also check CI caches and any shared Gradle distributions. Multi-module projects only need one wrapper update.

## Watch Out {.watch-out}

- If you're on Gradle 7.x, you can't jump straight to 8.14. Gradle deprecation cycles mean you need to fix warnings at each major version boundary. Plan for a staged upgrade: 7.x to 8.0, then 8.0 to 8.14+.
- The Gradle configuration cache is now stable and on by default in Gradle 9. If your build scripts use project-level state at execution time, you'll hit configuration cache errors after upgrading.

## Verify {.verify}

./gradlew --version shows 8.x+ and build succeeds

## Further Info {.further-info}

Maven builds are unaffected.
