/**
 * Tests the silent rename of the tracing-enabled property between Boot 3.5 and 4.0.
 *
 * Spring Boot 3.5.16:
 * - The property `management.tracing.enabled` is the canonical key for
 *   `@ConditionalOnEnabledTracing` in Boot's actuator auto-configuration.
 * - With `management.tracing.enabled=false` set in application.properties:
 *     • The `propagationFactory` bean (defined in
 *       BravePropagationConfigurations.PropagationWithBaggage and gated by
 *       @ConditionalOnEnabledTracing) is NOT created.
 *     • A noop CompositePropagationFactory is wired in its place.
 *     • Trace context is not propagated downstream — tracing is effectively disabled.
 * - assertion below passes.
 *
 * Spring Boot 4.0.7:
 * - The property has been renamed to `management.tracing.export.enabled`.
 *   (Source: official Boot 4.0 Migration Guide.)
 * - The annotation has been renamed to `@ConditionalOnEnabledTracingExport`.
 * - The legacy `management.tracing.enabled` is silently ignored.
 * - The new property defaults to TRUE when tracing dependencies are on the classpath.
 * - With only the legacy `=false` set:
 *     • `@ConditionalOnEnabledTracingExport` returns true (default).
 *     • The real `propagationFactory` bean IS created.
 *     • Trace context propagation runs as if tracing were enabled.
 * - The assertion below fires — the test catches the regression.
 *
 * This is a Tier 3 silent regression: no error, no warning, no log message.
 * A Boot 3.x application that explicitly disabled tracing in non-production
 * environments will silently start propagating and exporting trace context after
 * upgrading to 4.0 unless the property is also renamed.
 *
 * Fix: rename `management.tracing.enabled` → `management.tracing.export.enabled`.
 *      Any user code referencing `@ConditionalOnEnabledTracing` directly must
 *      also be renamed to `@ConditionalOnEnabledTracingExport`.
